Before you can use this plugin, you must enable the "companion" authentication method.
In the settings you can define a suffix that will be attached to the companion account.
If you need increased security, you can enable "forcelogin" in the plugin settings.
With this a new login will be requested after each change to the origin account.

If you are a teacher and you are on a course page, you will find a new entry **Switch to companion** in the user menu.
To switch back you will find the entry **Switch back** at the same place.
